## Introduction

Welcome to the Task Management Application! This project is the culmination of my journey in the software engineering program provided by ALX Africa. The application aims to provide a simple, user-friendly platform for individuals to manage their tasks effectively. You can easily add, edit, delete, and manage your tasks without any complications.

The deployed project can be accessed [here](https://neon-swan-bde043.netlify.app/).
